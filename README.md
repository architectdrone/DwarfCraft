# DwarfCraft

DwarfCraft is a map generator for Minecraft. It aims to make living underground more interesting. You've never seen caves like these before!

This is also, to the very best of my knowledge, the first project to use the Amulet API outside of the Amulet Editor.

## FAQ

### How do I run DwarfCraft?

Before running DwarfCraft, you need to have python 3.6+ installed. You also need the following python modules:

- Amulet Core
- Amulet NBT
- PyMCTranslate

Then, run the following command:

`python main.py <path to world> <size>`

### What if I want to play DwarfCraft, but I don't want to download all that stuff?

I'm looking into the best way to host pre-generated DwarfCraft files. Stay tuned!

### I am familiar with the Amulet API... why did you do <dumb thing\> when you could do <smart thing\>?

I did <dumb thing\> because I literally have no idea what I'm doing. I learned how to use Amulet from looking at the source code and the operations that are a part of Amulet Core. Please, make an issue explaining the right way to do it, or, better yet, a pull request. Maybe we can make it easier for others to build similar programs by examining mine!
